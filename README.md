# multi-trait and milti-site ABLUP and HBLUP
# The multi-trait and milti-site R-script fits the standard pedigree-based ABLUP and combined pedigree-genomic based HBLUP models using the breedR R-package. 
# The outputs of this R-script are the genetic and residual (co)variance components, and the breeding values and its accuracies for both models. 
# As an example, the RES-FOR lodgepole pine dataset (data_multi-trait_multi-site.txt) with 3 traits (DBH30, HT30, NSWGR36) and 4 sites (JUDY, VIRG, SWAN, and TIME)
# and the H-matrix calculated in blupf90 programs using the 8K ancestry selected SNPs.
# data_multi-trait_multi-site.txt was the demo dataset for the multi-trait and multi-site R script
